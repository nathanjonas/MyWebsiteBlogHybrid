          Hello world. I am a computer science student at the University of
          Cincinnati (UC), and I hope you enjoy this React project. Throughout
          my time at UC, I have been exposed to the digital world in the form of
          classwork and professional experience. I love it. I hope to continue
          my work upon graduation (04/2021) and begin my career as a software
          developer and designer.
